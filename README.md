===========

mBoy Issues has a goal of improving our current QA process of using Google Spreadsheets as a punchlist. We love GitHub issues but unfortunately it doesn't fit entirely into our workflow. Think of this as a simple clone of GitHub issues aimed at the QA phase of a project. Coded with Laravel and Polymer.

## Setup

<TODO: Actually have install docs.>

* Setup Laravel - `composer install`
* Setup database and run migrations - `php artisan migrate`
* Install packages - `npm install`
* Install components - `bower install`

## The Troop

Created with â™¥ by the [Monkee-Boy Troop](http://monkee-boy.com) in Austin, Texas.
